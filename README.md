# Dietary patterns and major chronic disease

This repository contains the programs for our project, in which we used data from the Nurses’ Health Studies (I/II) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study to compare eight dietary patterns with the risk of major chronic disease. We used SAS 9.4 for all the analyses.

**To access the data:**
Because of participant confidentiality and privacy concerns, data are available upon reasonable written request. According to standard controlled access procedure, applications to use the Nurses’ Health Studies and Health Professionals Follow-up Study resources will be reviewed by our External Collaborators Committee for scientific aims, evaluation of the fit of the data for the proposed methodology, and verification that the proposed use meets the guidelines of the Ethics and Governance Framework and the consent that was provided by the participants. Investigators wishing to use the Nurses’ Health Studies and Health Professionals Follow-up Study data are asked to submit a brief description of the proposed project. Further information including the procedures to obtain and access data from the Nurses’ Health Studies and Health Professionals Follow-up Study is described at https://www.nurseshealthstudy.org/researchers (contact email: nhsaccess@channing.harvard.edu) and https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/hpfs/for-collaborators/.
